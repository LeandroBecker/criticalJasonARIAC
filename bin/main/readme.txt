The experiment works as follows:
1) Change the origintal human_control.py in order to launch a version that artificially generates "critical events" (critical perceptions). Then run: 
ros2 launch ariac_gazebo ariac.launch.py trial_name:=human_kitting
2) The log is saved in 'ariac_ws', at least if running the above command from there. Rename it to txt to allow importing in google sheets.
