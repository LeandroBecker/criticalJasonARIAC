The file that gradlew needs to run is called 'build.gradle'

I have two possibilities, that are renamed to the needed one according to the experiment:
1) build-gradle.runLocal: created to support running the local Jason (CBS Jason)
2) build-gradle.standard: standard one, calls Jason on its repository
